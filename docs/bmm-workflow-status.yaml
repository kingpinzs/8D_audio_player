user_description: >
  I need to make one main html file that contains all the features and a working UI and fix the bugs of the audio output. 8d-audio-live-v3.html is the latest but it has the audio bugs in it and 8d-audio-live-v2.html does not seem like it has the bug in it. I need a production ready page that will allow drag and drop mp3s or stream like Pandora etc so all sound is 8d if I choose so.
