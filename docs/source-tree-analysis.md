# Source Tree Analysis – mp3_to_8D

## Repository Overview
This repository is a single-part web project (monolith). Instead of a bundler-managed `src/`
directory, each experience is delivered as a standalone HTML file that includes inline styles,
React components (via Babel Standalone), and Web Audio logic.

Hidden helper directories (not shown above):
- `.bmad/` – BMad workflow runtime
- `.bmad-ephemeral/` – scratch location for agents (currently empty)
- `.github/` – repository chatmode metadata

## Critical Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `8d-audio-live-v2.html` | Most reliable baseline for the 8D player. Uses React hooks, Web Audio API, drag-and-drop, and playlist persistence. |
| `8d-audio-live-v3.html` | Adds more aggressive binaural/noise controls plus UI polish; current bug affecting audio output originates here. |
| `8d-audio-converter-pro.html` | Utility experimenting with converting pre-recorded tracks into 8D renders. Shares the same audio graph helpers. |
| `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` | Active workflow tracker generated by `workflow-init`. |

## Entry Points
All HTML files are self-contained entry points. Because they rely on Web Audio, they must be served
via `http://` or `https://` (not `file://`). Development instructions should reference a lightweight
static server such as `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

## Integration Notes
- There is **no** bundler or module system yet. Refactoring into a modern toolchain will require
  extracting the inline React/Babel code into modules.
- Shared logic is duplicated between the HTML variants. When building the unified production page,
  the audio graph helpers in `8d-audio-live-v2.html` should be factored into reusable modules before
  merging the new UI from v3.
