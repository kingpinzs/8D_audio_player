# Brainstorming Session Results – mp3_to_8D

**Session Date:** 2025-11-11
**Participant:** Jeremy

## Executive Summary
- **Topic:** Build a unified 8D audio player that helps neurodivergent users (ADHD, autism, seasonal blues) focus, self-regulate, and feel happier via drag/drop streaming, curated presets, and research-backed audio layers.
- **Goals:** Simplify the UI while retaining advanced controls; pair 8D/binaural presets with biofeedback and journaling; auto-learn each family member’s best “stack”; surface credible research; empower parents/kids with minimal effort.
- **Techniques Used:** Question Storming, SCAMPER, Values Archaeology.
- **Total Idea Seeds:** 35 (questions + feature concepts + value statements).

## Technique Highlights
### Question Storming
Aimed at uncovering research and telemetry needs.
- What types of audio (8D, binaural, brown noise, solfeggio) help different neurodivergent profiles?
- Which studies validate 8D or binaural beats for ADHD/autism/anxiety? How do we cite them in-app?
- How can sensory sensitivities drive frequency/texture recommendations? What cues tell us a preset is calming vs energizing?
- How do tinnitus or other auditory conditions change our mixes?
- What objective markers (HRV, keystroke speed, app switching, pause frequency) indicate focus vs overload?
- Can webcams/heart-rate sensors (Galaxy Watch, Fitbit, Muse) feed adaptive presets while preserving privacy and consent?
- How do we log effectiveness automatically (self-journaling) and share insights with therapists/teachers?
- Can weather/time-of-day/work session length inform recommendations or break reminders?
- How do we let users share/suggest presets while maintaining decision-free simplicity?

### SCAMPER Insights
- **Substitute:** Default UI uses touch-friendly energy tiles/state selection; Advanced Mode exposes granular sliders.
- **Combine:** Mood presets blend with biometrics and quick tagging after drag/drop; focus ritual overlays playback; parent+child profile governance; dedicated experimental sandbox.
- **Adapt:** Borrow meditation rituals, Spotify-style “Daily Focus Stack,” screen-time scheduling, and accessibility patterns.
- **Modify:** Animate orbit visuals tied to spatial depth; one-tap “Start Focus” recalling last stack; accordion-based advanced sliders; 2-second emoji check-ins.
- **Put to Other Uses:** Auto-generated reset clips for dysregulation; self-journaling family history; preset export/sharing network.
- **Eliminate:** Merge all HTML variants; hide overlays unless advanced; drop unsupported streams (YouTube) until backend exists.
- **Reverse/Rearrange:** Start onboarding with desired state, not track; place focus ritual center stage; let the app observe a week of sessions before proposing defaults.

### Values Archaeology
- Builder also has ADHD/autism—tool must be genuinely useful for day-to-day engineering work.
- Desired outcome: users feel **focused + happy**, not just calm.
- Maintain a balance of control and simplicity; science-backed safety with room for experimentation; autonomy with guardrails.
- North Star: “Find the perfect setting for each user so they can focus, achieve, and feel supported.”

## Idea Buckets
### Immediate Opportunities
1. Unified single-page player with state-first quick start + Advanced Mode toggle.
2. Auto journaling session outcomes (no manual input) with shareable summaries for caregivers/therapists.
3. Reset clips + ritual overlays for fast regulation.

### Future Innovations
- Biometric-adaptive presets (wearables/webcam cues) with privacy-safe opt-ins.
- Time-of-day/weather-aware “Daily Focus Stack.”
- Community preset exchange with safety filters.

### Moonshots
- Behavioral fingerprinting that learns effective stacks across family members and auto-configures sessions.
- Multi-sensor dashboard (keystrokes, HRV, micro-expressions) that nudges breaks and suggests tone layers dynamically.

## Action Starters
1. **Research Package:** Dig into clinical/academic evidence on 8D, binaural beats, brown noise for ADHD/autism/anxiety; catalog credible references.
2. **Unified UX Design:** Wireframe state-first home, Advanced Mode, experimental sandbox, and ritual overlay.
3. **Instrumentation Plan:** Define telemetry schema (session length, track metadata, user reactions) + opt-in biometric inputs.

## Reflection & Follow-up
- **What worked:** Layering question storming before SCAMPER ensured ideas stayed anchored in actual science/user needs. Values Archaeology kept the mission personal and motivating.
- **Still to explore:** Detailed research findings, therapist validation, backend requirements for secure data syncing.
- **Recommended next workflow:** `research` (analyst) leveraging these prompts as inputs.
